# Space and Engineering Academy Senior Project
## Hurdle Carts
My team members:
- Qudsi Aljabiri
- Wentinn Liao
- Brandon Lindner
- and me, Pranav Banuru

Side Note: This will have some powerpoint slides included due to the nice formatting.

## Project Concept:

- Make carrying & transporting hurdles easier.
- Make setup and removal of hurdles faster.


   - as hurdles are made of metal and come in large numbers.
- Each cart holds 8 Hurdles, 10 Carts, for 80 hurdles used in races.
- General design was found online but modified for a wood build.

## Our Target Organization and Goal
- For Merrill F. West High School Track & Field Team
  - for the hurdlers and the rest of the team for tightly scheduled meets.
- To make transporting hurdles much easier and faster  
   (setting up hurdles by hand is a tedious process)
- To be stored under WHS bleachers.

## Raw Materials Costs
Cost of everything that is physically part of the hurdle.  
This excludes items such as blue tape and sandpaper, among others.

~ $1091 for 10 hurdle carts or ~$109 per cart.  
Fairly accurate estimate, but it depends on the amount of wood filler used to smooth out the wood per cart.

## Full Materials Costs

In total, this project would have costed us ~$1450 without donations, which we are very thankful for.

The price us four put in, in total, was $1200.
