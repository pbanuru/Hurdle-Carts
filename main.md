# Space and Engineering Academy Senior Project
## Hurdle Carts
My team members:
- Qudsi Aljabiri
- Wentinn Liao
- Brandon Lindner
- and me, Pranav Banuru

Side Note: This will have some powerpoint slides included due to the nice formatting.

## Project Concept:

- Make carrying & transporting hurdles easier.
- Make setup and removal of hurdles faster.


   - as hurdles are made of metal and come in large numbers.
- Each cart holds 8 Hurdles, 10 Carts, for 80 hurdles used in races.
- General design was found online but modified for a wood build.

## Our Target Organization and Goal
- For Merrill F. West High School Track & Field Team
  - for the hurdlers and the rest of the team for tightly scheduled meets.
- To make transporting hurdles much easier and faster  
   (setting up hurdles by hand is a tedious process)
- To be stored under WHS bleachers.

## Raw Materials Costs
Cost of everything that is physically part of the hurdle.  
This excludes items such as blue tape and sandpaper, among others.

<img src = "images/4.1.jpg" height=auto width=80%/>
 
~ $1091 for 10 hurdle carts or ~$109 per cart.  
Fairly accurate estimate, but it depends on the amount of wood filler used to smooth out the wood per cart.

## Full Materials Costs

In total, this project would have costed us ~$1450 without donations, which we are very thankful for.

The price us four put in, in total, was $1200.

## Details
### Some of these will make more sense later on.

- 9/64’ bit used for pilot hole, countersink and wood boring bit for 4’ and 2.5’ wood screws
  
- Perpendicular cuts made with a circular (Milter) saw, but diagonal cuts were done manually for accuracy
  
- All wood parts except for the two primary layers were sanded and stained before construction
  
    - Two layers were sanded, built, then stained as a whole
    - Heaters and fans used to speed up drying
- Putty used to cover the drill holes, then sanded and repainted
- Entire wood frame, excluding the handle and handle braces built before adding wheels
- Two wood beams added, a horizontal to brace the handle beams and another to support plywood
- Metal angle braces drilled to align the white vertical supports
- Initially, the Wolfpack and West High stickers were printed then lacquered onto the plywood
    - Lacquer produced a brown tint after drying, so we replaced the plywood with banners.
    - Banners were printed and drilled onto the plywood
    - Easily replaceable and more resistant to damages, ie. water and scratching
- Bedliner sprayed on the bottom layer to prevent scratches from the hurdle edges
- Bolts holding the swiveling tires were ground with an angle grinder to prevent hitting the axle
- Touching up included puttying rough surfaces, sanding and repainting, and cleaning
