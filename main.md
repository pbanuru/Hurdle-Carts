## Project Concept:

- Make carrying & transporting hurdles easier.
- Make setup and removal of hurdles faster.


   - as hurdles are made of metal and come in large numbers.
- Each cart holds 8 Hurdles, 10 Carts, for 80 hurdles used in races.
- General design was found online but modified for a wood build.
